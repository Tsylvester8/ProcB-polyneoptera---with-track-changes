\begin{abstract}
The structure of a genome can be described at its simplest by the number of chromosomes and the sex chromosome system it contains. 
Despite over a century of study, the evolution of genome structure on this scale remains recalcitrant to broad generalisations that can be applied across clades. 
To address this issue, we have assembled a dataset of 823 karyotypes from the insect group Polyneoptera. 
This group contains orders with a range of variations in chromosome number, and offer the opportunity to explore the possible causes of these differences.
We have analysed this data using both phylogenetic and taxonomic approaches.
Our analysis allows us to assess the importance of rates of evolution, phylogenetic history, sex chromosome systems, parthenogenesis, and genome size on variation in chromosome number within clades. 
We find that fusions play a key role in the origin of new sex chromosomes, and that orders exhibit striking differences in rates of fusions, fissions, or polyploidy.
Our results suggest that the difficulty in finding consistent rules that govern evolution at this scale may be due to the presence of many interacting forces that can lead to variation among groups.

\section{Introduction}
Chromosome number is one of the fundamental characteristics of a genome.
It is also the first information collected about most genomes. 
In fact, the first chromosome counts were recorded prior to the development of the chromosome theory of inheritance \cite{flemming1882}.
Despite this early start, consistent rules governing the evolution of chromosome number across large clades remain elusive.

Changes in chromosome number can happen due to several mechanisms.
We use the term fusion and fission to describe respectively a decrease or an increase of one in chromosome number.
However, these terms are simplifications and may represent multiple processes at

the molecular level.
Reduction in chromosome number can happen through Robertsonian translocations with the loss of nonessential DNA \cite{garagna1995}.
Reductions can also happen through the fusion of two chromosomes at the telomeres followed by loss of one of the centromeres \cite{gordon2011mechanisms, miga2016}.
In contrast, increases in chromosome number can occur due to simple chromosome fission in the centromere region \cite{moretti1984}.
Increases in chromosome number can also happen due to the duplication of an entire chromosome.
Changes in chromosome number of more than one can also occur.
Although rare in most animal groups, demiploidy describes an increase chromosome number by one-half. 
Demiploidy events can occur by the joining of haploid gamete with an unreduced diploid gamete \cite{hornsey1973}.
Finally, whole-genome duplication can lead to a doubling of chromosome number \cite{beccak1970}.

These changes in chromosome number can have broad impacts on gene transcription, recombination rates, and sex chromosome evolution.
Presence of an extra copy of a chromosome can lead to both increases and decreases in gene transcription.  
For instance, the presence of a third copy of a chromosome can lead to approximately a four per cent increase in gene expression across all chromosomes and a 1.5-fold increase in expression of genes on that chromosome \cite{lockstone2007, williams2008aneuploidy}.
In \textit{Drosophila} females with three X chromosomes, expression of genes in each X chromosome is reduced such that the total X chromosome gene expression matches with that of females with two X chromosomes \cite{sun2013dosage}.
However, the presence of an extra copy of the X chromosome in \textit{Drosophila} females leads to a 33\% reduction in the expression of genes on the autosomes \cite{sun2013dosage}. 

It has long been recognised that chromosome number should positively correlate with genome-wide recombination rates \cite{stebbins1958}.
The frequency of recombination events and the proper segregation of chromosomes into gametes is dependent on crossing over in meiosis.
The lower limit of the number of crossing over events is controlled by the number of chromosome arms in most species and by the number of chromosomes in some species \cite{dumont2017req}.
This relationship between chromosome number and recombination has been suggested as a source of indirect selection on chromosome number in Hymenoptera though recent analysis suggest this may be only a weak force \cite{ross2015, sherman1979}.
Reduced recombination between loci (due to a fusion between an autosome and the sex chromosomes --- reducing chromosome number) has been implicated in the speciation of the Japan Sea stickleback \cite{kitano2012}. 

Changes in chromosome number can have impacts on the evolution and behaviour of sex chromosomes. 
For instance, if chromosomes are broken into smaller chromosomes while keeping all else equal (e.g. genome size), the average chromosome size should be negatively correlated with the number of chromosomes.
This can have important impacts on the fate of sex chromosomes.
A comparative study of Coleoptera has shown that species are more likely to lose the Y chromosome and transition from XY to XO if they have many small chromosomes rather than a few larger chromosomes \cite{blackmon2015bioessay}.
It has been hypothesized that this pattern is driven by the size of the region available for recombination between the X and Y chromosome during male meiosis and the frequency that males will produce aneuploid gametes \cite{blackmon2014}.
However, in some species, this may be averted by cell cycle checkpoints that lead to apoptosis of cells that fail to properly segregate the sex chromosomes \cite{dumont2017par}.

In sexual species, it is often assumed that changes in chromosome number are underdominant--heterozygotes have reduced fitness \cite{white1973} . 
Chromosomal heterozygosity occurs when the chromosome
% TS: changed compliment to complement. - reply for R2.2
\textcolor{red}{\st{compliment}} \textcolor{blue}{complement} from the parents differs.
For instance, if one parent contributes a single fused chromosome and the other contributes two separate chromosomes.
Perhaps the most widely known example of this is hybridisation between horses and donkeys where the offspring carries 32 chromosomes from the mother and 31 chromosomes from the father. 
When this mule attempts to produce gametes the rearrangements that have occurred lead to gametes lacking a full set of all genes in the genome and thus, they are sterile \cite{wodsedalek1916}. 
It should be noted that this fitness reduction is not always observed.
In wild mice which are heterozygous for a single fusion between chromosomes 16 and 17, there is no significant reduction in fertility and thus no reduction in fitness \cite{britton1990robertsonian}.
A large number of crosses in lemurs (where the chromosome number ranged from 44 to 60) exhibit a full range of fitness effects of changes in chromosome number.
Four of twelve hybrids exhibit normal spermatogenesis while six of twelve exhibits reduced spermatogenesis while the final two hybrids exhibited major perturbations to spermatogenesis \cite{ratomponirina1988}.   
In contrast, one can hypothesise that changes in chromosome number might be less deleterious in asexual species since they do not have to pair with any other genome in the population.
Consistent with this asexual species have considerable variation in chromosome number.
In parthenogenetic beetle species, we find polyploid races within species where the total chromosome number of polyploid races is a multiple of the haploid number.
For example, in weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the species \textit{Catapionus gracilicornis} has polyploid races with chromosome numbers of 22, 33, 44 and 55 \cite{lachowska1998}. 

To better understand the dynamics of chromosome evolution we have chosen to work with the insect clade Polyneoptera which includes commonly known groups such as termites, grasshoppers, and cockroaches.
This group contains the orders Blattodea (including Isoptera), Dermaptera, Embiidina, Mantodea, Notoptera, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, and Plecoptera.
These orders show striking variation in chromosome number, sex chromosome systems (i.e. XX/XO, XX/XY or complex XY) and, include sexual and asexual species. 
We have assembled a large trait dataset of chromosome number, Sex Chromosome System (SCS), and reproductive mode.
We analysed this data in both a taxonomic and a phylogenetic framework to determine the impact of the sexual system on rates of chromosome number evolution, the source of transitions in SCSs, and identify differences in patterns of chromosome number evolution across orders.

\section{Material and methods}

\subsection{Chromosome data}
We downloaded all available chromosome data for the clade Polyneoptera from the Tree of Sex database \cite{blackmon2016,TOS2014}.
To supplement this data, we performed literature searches for each order in Polyneoptera.
Briefly, we combined order names with the terms "cytogenetic", "cytotaxonomic", "karyotype", and "sex chromosome system".
For each species in our dataset, we made an attempt to score three traits: chromosome number, SCS, and reproductive mode (sexual vs. asexual).
In cases where there were multiple records for a species that had different values, we retained all reported values.
This process yielded a final dataset of 823 records, 773 of which are unique taxa, with the remaining records representing species that have variability in one of the recorded traits (Table S1).

\subsection{Phylogenetic data}
We used PyPHLAWD to retrieve sequence clusters and used clusters which had at least 100 species for our analysis \cite{smith2018phyphlawd}. 
These included three mitochondrial genes (COI, COX2 and ND4) and three nuclear

regions (\textcolor{red}{\st{18s}} \textcolor{blue}{18S} and two regions of the \textcolor{red}{\st{28s}} \textcolor{blue}{28S} gene). 
We removed duplicate sequences and retained the longest example for each species using the function FastaFilter in the R package evobiR \cite{blackmon2015evobir}.
To maximise the overlap between our trait and sequence datasets we first found all species-level exact matches in both datasets.
% TS: changed genera level and genus level to genus-level and species level to species-level - reply for R2.4
Next, we looked for \textcolor{red}{\st{genera level}} \textcolor{blue}{genus-level} matches that lacked \textcolor{red}{\st{species level}} \textcolor{blue}{species-level} matches.
For each of these \textcolor{red}{\st{genus level}} \textcolor{blue}{genus-level} matches, we retained the longest sequence for each locus from any species in the genus and used these sequences to act as a tip representing the genus rather than any single species. 
This process of maximising the overlap between the two datasets created 57 exemplar taxa (genera tips).

We used MAFFT under default settings to align all sequences \cite{katoh2013mafft}.
For the aligned RNA coding sequences, we used GBLOCKS to remove hypervariable regions \cite{castresana2000gblocks}. 
When running GBLOCKS, we used default settings with the exception of the allowed gap positions argument which was set to maximum. 
For the 18S sequence cluster, we also set the minimum block length to 6 to retain a greater proportion of the alignment. 
For the protein-coding genes, we manually adjusted the starting position of the alignments to maintain the reading frame. 
Using the supermatrix function in the R package evobiR, individual gene alignments were then concatenated into a supermatrix with 7380 sites \cite{blackmon2015evobir}.

The presence of rogue taxa (taxa that have an inconsistent placement in a set of phylogenetic trees) can produce unreliable rate inferences similar to that found in analyses of supertrees \cite{aberer2012roguetaxa, rabosky2015b}.
To identify the presence of rogue taxa, we generated 100 maximum likelihood rapid bootstrap trees using RAxML v 8.2.10 implemented in CIPRES Science Gateway \cite{stamatakis2014raxml,miller2010cipres}.
Using these trees, we calculated the taxonomic instability index as implemented in Mesquite v 3.51 \cite{maddison2018mesquite}.
When we examined taxonomic instability indices, we found that a score of 4870 was an inflexion point (Figure S1).
We identified 16 taxa whose taxonomic instability index was higher and removed them from subsequent analysis.
Our final alignment contained 232 taxonomic units with 73\% missing data.

We used BEAST v 2.5 \cite{bouckaert2014beast} to infer time-calibrated phylogenies under a relaxed lognormal clock, a birth-death model, and GTR + G as the nucleotide substitution model.
The mitochondrial and nuclear coding genes were partitioned into all three coding positions. 
We used previous estimates for the ages of seven nodes (Table S2) in our phylogeny drawn from a previous study of divergence times across insects \cite{misof2014phylogenomics}.
For each of these calibration points, we used a normal distribution.
The upper and lower bounds of the calibration points (95\textsuperscript{th} and 5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles respectively) were placed according to the confidence intervals as presented in Misof et al. \cite{misof2014phylogenomics}. 
We conducted two independent runs, each for 100 million generations.
The convergence of these two independent runs was evaluated using Tracer v 1.7 \cite{rambaut2018tracer}.
The initial 50\% of each MCMC run was discarded as burnin and 50 phylogenetic trees were randomly sampled from the post-burnin period of each run to construct a posterior distribution of 100 trees used for trait analyses described below.

The presence of parthenogenetic taxa in our dataset allows us to ask how reproductive mode affects chromosome number evolution.
However, the parthenogenetic mode of reproduction is only present in Phasmatodea.
Therefore we built a second phylogeny, for Phasmatodea, that included more species from our trait dataset.
To do this we supplemented the sequence data from PyPHLAWD with additional data located using the PhyLoTA web server \cite{sanderson2008}.
This increased our samples from 28 species, which we had in Polyneoptera dataset, to 41 species. 
This new dataset included three mitochondrial genes (16s, COI, COX2) and three
% TS: changed 18s and 28s to 18S and 28S - reply for R1.2
nuclear genes (\textcolor{red}{\st{18s}} \textcolor{blue}{18S}, \textcolor{red}{\st{28s}} \textcolor{blue}{28S} and H3).
The new alignment consisted of 57\% missing data.
We inferred time-calibrated phylogenies as described above.


\subsection{Modeling chromosome evolution}
We used R packages diversitree and chromePlus to model chromosome number evolution in a Bayesian framework \cite{fitzjohn2012, blackmon2019meiotic}.
To get reliable estimates for the rates of chromosome number evolution, we only analysed the four orders with at least 20 representatives.
We tested two versions of our model, a simple model with chromosome fission and fusion and a complex model which included fission, fusion, and polyploidy.
Although we use the terms fusion and fission for convenience, it should be noted that these are simply changes (decreases and increases respectively) in the haploid number by one.
Based on the likelihood ratio test results, we used the complex model to estimate the rates of chromosome evolution.

To account for uncertainty in chromosome number (e.g., when there were reports of multiple values for a tip in our phylogeny), we randomly sampled among the possible values.
This random sampling was repeated for each tree that we analysed.
To account for uncertainty in phylogeny, we ran an MCMC of 1000 generations for each of the 100 trees drawn from the posterior distribution.
Inspection of the parameter estimates revealed that our MCMC runs converged by 50 generations in most cases.  
We conservatively discarded the initial 25\% (250 states) as burnin and randomly sampled 100 states from the post-burnin portion of the run. 
This process yielded 10,000 point estimates that define the posterior distribution of the parameters in our model.
We tested for differences in rates of chromosome evolution by comparing the 95\% credible interval of the posterior distribution for each parameter in our model.
Rates were inferred with branch lengths transformed to make trees unit length.
However, all rates reported have been back-transformed so they represent transition rates in units of millions of years.

\textcolor{blue}{All these rates that we describe hererin are the lambda parameters of the exponential distributions inferred from our Markov model (described above) that describe the waiting time for a transition to occur.}

% TS: added a paragraph to state that the ChromPlus model that we used can incorporate binary traits and see the impact on these binary traits on chromosome number evolution. - reply for R1.3
\textcolor{blue}{The ChromPlus model that we use here to model chromosome number evolution can also be used to look at the impact of binary states (i.e. states that can be classified as 1 and 0) on chromosome number evolution \cite{blackmon2019meiotic}. We used this capability of the ChromPlus model to asses the impact on mode of reproduction on chromosome number evolution. In this analysis we used the second phylogeny we inferred for Phasmatodea and ran an MCMC es explained above. We used sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis as our binary states.}

We also tested whether genome size as a proxy for repetitive content might explain the rate differences that we observed among orders \cite{kidwell2002transposable,bennetzen2005mechanisms}. 
% TS: added a section to further clarify that below mentioned analysis looks at the variation of genome size that we see between these orders could explain the rates of chromosome number evolution of these orders. - reply for R1.3
\textcolor{blue}{Expansions in genome size are largely due to repetitive content, especially transposable elements.}
\textcolor{blue}{We hypothesis that presence of repetetive content allows structural changes in the geome such as fusions and/or fissions and therefore we expect to see higher rates of fusions and/or fissions in larger genomes.}
\textcolor{blue}{To test this, we downloaded }
\textcolor{red}{\st{Genome }} \textcolor{blue}{genome} size data for all available species in Polyneoptera \textcolor{red}{\st{were downloaded}} from the animal genome size database \cite{gregory2019}.
When multiple values for a single species were present the mean of each species was used.
We then fit three linear models to test whether the mean genome size for an order predicted the mean rate estimate for chromosome gains, losses, and polyploidy. 
Linear models were fit using the R function lm from base R \cite{R-citation}.

\textcolor{blue}{We have also tested whether there is a correlation between the genome size and the chromosome number as well.}
\textcolor{blue}{We used the lm function in base R to construct a liner model without correcting for phylogeny and the function phylolm in the package phylolm to construct a linear model with the phylogenetic correction \cite{R-citation, phylolm}.}

\subsection{Ancestral state reconstructions}
% TS: added recap on the traits on which we inferred the ancestral states. - reply for R1.6
\textcolor{blue}{We estimated the ancestral states of two traits; chromosome number and the sex chromosome system (SCS).}
We estimated the ancestral states of the chromosome number at the root of each orders using ChromEvol v 2.0. \cite{glick2014chromevol, mayrose2009chromevol}.
We used a fixed parameter model which included chromosome gains, losses, and whole-genome duplication---matching the model used in ChromePlus.
For each tree from our posterior distribution, we took the mean of each parameter estimate from the corresponding post-burnin portion of the ChromPlus analysis described above and supplied these to infer ancestral states in ChromEvol.
We integrated the estimates from the analysis of all 100 trees for each order to generate an ancestral state estimate that accounts for uncertainty in phylogeny and tip states. 

The estimate of ancestral states for SCSs was done using a Markov model in the function ACE in the R package APE \cite{Paradis2018}.
We classified multi-XY SCS as XY which resulted in two states (XO and XY) for the ancestral states reconstruction of the SCS. 
Our model allowed for transitions between XO and XY to occur at unequal rates.
To estimate the number of transitions in SCSs, we created the same model and performed stochastic mappings in the R package phytools \cite{revell2012phytools}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Evolution of sex chromosome systems}
In our dataset, 21 genera contain species with different types of SCSs (i.e. XO XY, and or multi-XY).
In each of these genera, we calculated the mean autosome number for all species with a given type of SCS.
By comparing these means within genera, we can determine if differences are consistent with fusions or fissions as a source of transitions among SCSs.
Briefly, if transitions from XO to XY are generated by the fusion of an autosome to a sex chromosome we would expect a lower mean autosome number for XY species.
Likewise, if transitions from XY to multi-XY are generated by the fusion of an autosome to a sex chromosome we would expect a lower mean chromosome number for multi-XY species.
In contrast, if transitions from XY to multi-XY are generated by the fission of a sex chromosome we would expect no difference in the number of autosomes.

We find strong support for fusions as a source of transitions from XO to XY SCSs.
Of the 16 genera with both XO and XY species, 94\% (16/17) show a lower mean chromosome number in XY species (Table \ref{tab:fusions}). 
However, we find support for both fusions and fissions leading to transitions from XY to multi-XY.
While 43\% (3/7) of the genera with both XY and multi-XY have a higher mean autosome number in multi-XY species, 57\% (4/7) of the genera with both XY and multi-XY have a higher mean autosome number in XY species.
This analysis is limited to only those genera with variation in SCSs and thus omits much of our data.
When autosome number among orders is parsed by SCS, differences suggests that in some groups the origin of transitions may differ from our
% TS: changed genera level and genus level to genus-level and species level to species-level - reply for R2.4
\textcolor{red}{\st{genus level}} \textcolor{blue}{genus-level} analysis.
For instance, the mean of all XY species in both Blattodea (including Isoptera) and Dermaptera is higher than the mean of XO species in both orders.
This pattern is not expected if fusions are the primary source of transitions from XO to XY in these groups (Figure S2).

\subsection{Ancestral states and rates of sex chromosome evolution}

We find that the ancestral state for SCS in Polyneoptera clade was XO, with a probability of 90.3\%.
Similarly, the most probable ancestral state for each order was also XO, except for Isoptera and Dermaptera where XY is more probable (Fig. \ref{fig:sex.asr.plot}).
We find that the credible interval of the transition rates from XO to XY and XY to XO to be largely overlapping with means of 0.00202 and 0.00200 respectively. 
To assess the number of transitions between XY and XO we calculated the number of transitions from 100 stochastic maps for each of the 100 trees from the posterior sample.
Transitions from XO to XY were more common (mean = 15.3) while transitions from XY to XO were relatively rare (mean = 6.7).

\subsection{Chromosome number variation}
We find a significant difference in variance in chromosome numbers among the orders of Polyneoptera (Levene's test p-value: 2.2e-16). 
Blattodea (including Isoptera) (n = 172), had the highest variance in chromosome number (39.32) and  Embiidina (n = 8), had the lowest variance in chromosome number (0.41).
Orthoptera, despite having 319 records, had a low variance in chromosome number (2.87). 
Posthoc tests showed that Blattodea (including Isoptera) had a higher variance in chromosome number than Embiidina, Mantodea, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, and Plecoptera (all p-values $<$ 0.05). 
Likewise, Dermaptera had a higher variance in chromosome number than Mantodea and Orthoptera (all p-values $<$ 0.05). Finally, Orthoptera had a lower variance in chromosome number than Phasmatodea (p-value $<$ 0.05).
Much of these differences in variance are obvious even when looking at the reduced phylogenetic dataset in Fig. \ref{fig:phyloplot}.

\subsection{Chromosome Number Evolution Rate inference}
Though differences in chromosome number variance suggest some orders are evolving more quickly, we must control for the phylogeny in order to draw any rigorous conclusions.
To do this we used a probabilistic model of chromosome evolution that can accommodate fusions, fissions, and whole genome duplications.
We began with a base model that includes only fusions and fissions and compared this via a likelihood ratio test with a model that included polyploidy as well.
We repeated this likelihood ratio test on each of the 100 trees from our posterior distribution for each order.
All orders showed some support for the model including polyploidy and overall, 77.6\% of our likelihood ratio tests supported the more complex model that included polyploidy.
For this reason, all analyses were done with a model that had fusions, fissions, and polyploidy.
In Blattodea (including Isoptera), we estimate a mean fusion rate of 0.128, a fission rate of 0.150, and a polyploidy rate of 0.003 (Table S3).
In contrast, if we remove the subclade Isoptera from Blattodea we find that parameter estimates increase to 0.420, 0.385, and 0.004 for fusions, fissions and polyploidy respectively.
This is consistent with rate estimates for Isoptera in isolation, where we infer
% TS: added a comma after 0.063 - reply for R2.7
a mean fusion rate of 0.044, a fission rate of \textcolor{red}{\st{0.063 and a polyploidy rate}} \textcolor{blue}{0.063, and a polyploidy rate} of 0.003.
In Mantodea, we estimate a mean fusion rate of 0.142, a fission rate of 0.056, and a polyploidy rate of 0.139.
Mantodea rate estimates also exhibited high uncertainty, overlapping rate estimates in most orders for most parameters (Fig. \ref{fig:order.rates.95HPD}, Figure S3).
In Phasmatodea, we estimate a mean fusion rate of 0.47, a fission rate of 0.145, and a polyploidy rate of 0.039.
Some of the lowest rates we estimated were in Orthoptera where the fusion rate was 0.003 and the fission rate was 0.024. However, we do find the polyploidy rate to be relatively high with a mean rate of 0.101.

Genome size data were available for 123 Polyneoptera species in the orders Phasmatodea, Orthoptera, Mantodea, and Blattodea (including Isoptera).
Mean genome size of these orders ranged from a low of 1.23 Gbp in Isoptera to a high of 7.92 Gbp in Orthoptera (Table S4).
% TS: changed rate of chromosome evolution to rate of chromosome number evolution. - reply for R1.8
We fit three linear models where the mean \textcolor{red}{\st{rate of chromosome evolution}} \textcolor{blue}{rate of chromosome number evolution} (gains, losses, and polyploidy) were a function of the mean genome size of an order.
None of these linear models was significant (all p-values $>$ 0.15 without correction for multiple comparisons).
Furthermore, some of the very lowest rates were observed in Orthoptera which had the largest mean genome size.
% TS: added the results on the correlation between the genome size and the chromosome number. - reply for editors comment on the power of our analysis on genome size and rate of chromosome number evolution.
\textcolor{blue}{In our comparison between genome size and chromosome number, we did not find any significant relationship as well (p values both before and after correcting for phylogeny were > 0.05) (Figure SX).}

\subsection{Chromosome Number Ancestral state reconstruction}
In reporting ancestral chromosome number in each order, we averaged probabilities across all 100 trees from the posterior distribution. 
Our analysis of Orthoptera suggests six is the most probable ancestral state for the order, with a 75.1\% probability.
However, a chromosome number of three is given a probability of 24.5\% which may suggest an early whole-genome duplication in this clade.
Support for the lower ancestral state was concentrated in 19 trees where the most probable state was 3 in all other trees 6 was given the highest probability (Figure S4).
% TS: All the edits in this section of the results (Chromosome Number Ancestral state reconstruction) are the addition of the mean chromosome number for the orders where we inferred the ancestral chromosome number in each order. - reply for R1.11
\textcolor{blue}{The most common chromosome number in Orthoptera in our dataset was 12.}
In Blattodea including Isoptera, the most probable chromosome number was 13 with a probability of 20.9\% followed by 14 and 12 with probabilities 19.5\% and 16.4\% respectively. 
\textcolor{blue}{The most common chromosome number in Blattodea including Isoptera in our dataset was 21.}
In Blattodea excluding Isoptera, the most probable chromosome number was 7 with a probability of 11.9\% followed by 8 and 9 with probabilities 11.6\% and 11.2\% respectively.
\textcolor{blue}{The most common chromosome number in Blattodea excluding Isoptera in our dataset was 19.}
In Isoptera, the most probable chromosome number was 20 with a probability of 35.6\% followed by 21 and 22 with probabilities 30.7\% and 14.0\% respectively.
\textcolor{blue}{The most common chromosome number in Isoptera in our dataset was 21.}
In Mantodea, the most probable chromosome number was 8 with a probability of 41.2\% followed by 9 and 7 with probabilities 19.2\% and 16.1\% respectively.
\textcolor{blue}{The most common chromosome number in Mantodea in our dataset was 14.}
Finally, in Phasmatodea, the most probable chromosome number was 9 with a probability of 11.7\% followed by 10 and 11 with probabilities 11.3\% and 10.7\% respectively \textcolor{red}{\st{.}} \textcolor{blue}{and  the most common chromosome number in Phasmatodea in our dataset was 18.}
\textcolor{blue}{All these chromosome numbers reported here are haploid chromosome numbers.}

\subsection{Asexuality and rates of chromosome evolution}
Our dataset contains 13 parthenogenetic species.
All these species were within Phasmatodea.
Using our expanded Phasmatodea phylogenies we tested whether the rates of chromosome evolution are contingent on the reproductive mode (Figure S5).
We found that there is no significant difference in the rates of chromosome fusion and fission between sexually and asexually reproducing species.
However, we find that rates of polyploidy are significantly higher in asexually reproducing species than in sexually reproducing species (Fig. \ref{fig:phas.plot}).

The evolution of chromosome number across large clades and long time spans is fundamental to the diversity of genomes we observe across the tree of life.
Despite this, we are only beginning to understand how chromosome number evolves.
In this study, we have focused on the dynamics of chromosome evolution in Polyneoptera. 
Our analyses have revealed that this clade originated from an XO ancestor. 
We find that fusions have led to many new XY and multi-XY systems, and that only a few instances of fissions producing multi-XY systems appear to have occurred.
% TS: changed rate of chromosome evolution to rate of chromosome number evolution. - reply for R1.8
We see a rapid decline in the \textcolor{red}{\st{rate of chromosome evolution}} \textcolor{blue}{rate of chromosome number evolution} that coincides with the origin of eusocial Blattodea (Isoptera).
This is the opposite of the pattern documented in Hymenoptera \cite{ross2015}.
In Phasmatodea, we find that transitions into parthenogenetic reproduction allow for a high rate of polyploidy but no significant increase in rates of dysploidy.

\subsection{Sex chromosomes and chromosomes number evolution}
The transition between SCSs from XO to XY can occur through X chromosome autosome fusions or by sex chromosome turnover with fixation of the ancestral X
% TS: added citations. reply for R2.9
as a new autosome\textcolor{blue}{\cite{charlesworth1980, white1973}}.
Transition via fusion will lead to a reduction in the total number of autosomes, while turnover should lead to an increase in the total number of autosomes.
The data that we have collected shows a clear pattern of reduced autosome number in taxa with recent XO to XY transitions (Table \ref{tab:fusions}).
Transition from XY to multi-XY can occur through sex chromosome autosome fusions or by sex chromosome fission.
Transition via fusion will lead to a reduction in the total number of autosomes while fissions will lead to no change in the autosome number.
In contrast to the pattern observed in XO to XY transitions, transitions from XY to multi-XY show a mixed pattern with some having increased autosome number and some having decreased autosome number in taxa with recent XY to multi-XY transitions (Table \ref{tab:fusions}).
We interpret this as evidence for both fusions and fissions as an important source of multi-XY systems.
These SCS transitions could be neutral and fix simply due to drift or sexually antagonistic variation on autosome may lead to positive selection for increasing proportions of the genome becoming sex-linked through fusions \cite{charlesworth1980, kitano2012}.
Combining our results for XO to XY and XY to multi-XY transitions we find that fusions are a dominant route for changes in SCSs a pattern consistent with common sexual antagonistic variation on autosomes leading to selection for fusions. 

Our assembled data can also help us understand the fate of the Y chromosomes. 
It has been suggested that Y chromosomes may be destined to decay and loss given the inevitability of mutation accumulation due to lack of recombination \cite{steinemann2005}.
Alternatively, they may be retained through cycles of rejuvenation or even transitions into alternative forms of meiosis \cite{blackmon2015bioessay}.
In our inference of SCS evolution, we performed stochastic mappings that allow us to estimate the rate of Y chromosome loss and the number of inferred losses in our dataset.
The rate of Y chromosome gains and Y chromosome losses are both approximately 0.002 (Table S5). 
However, we find that Y chromosome gains are more common with a mean of 15.3 while losses are relatively rare with a mean of 6.7. 
This pattern is intuitive when we consider that the ancestor of this group was likely XO and thus there has been relatively little time for the gain of the Y chromosome to then be followed by its decay and loss.

\textcolor{blue}{Additionally, coupled with the evidence that X chromosome of German cockroach, \textit{Blattella germanica} (Blattodea), is highly conserved over 400 million years we suggest that the X chromosome in Polyneoptera species with XO sex chromosome system had a common origin \cite{meisel2019x}.}

\subsection{Eusociality and chromosome number}
In our analysis of Blattodea (including Isoptera), we inferred a significantly
% TS: changed rate of chromosome evolution to rate of chromosome number evolution. - reply for R1.8
lower \textcolor{red}{\st{rate of chromosome evolution}} \textcolor{blue}{rate of chromosome number evolution} in the subclade Isoptera than the rest of Blattodea (excluding Isoptera).
In the past, it has been hypothesised that large rate differences, for instance, those seen among some mammal clades might be explained by differences in effective population size \cite{bush1977rapid}.
Future work that examined effective population sizes of solitary Blattodea (excluding Isoptera) and eusocial Isoptera might reveal whether the observed rate differences in these lineages is consistent with this earlier hypothesis that large effective population size is associated with lower rates of chromosome evolution.
It should be noted though that more recent phylogenetically informed analysis of over 1000 species of mammals showed that female meiotic drive may be a primary driver of chromosome number evolution in mammals \cite{blackmon2019meiotic}.
Furthermore, the rate difference that we infer among the eusocial and solitary lineages of Blattodea are in the opposite direction of those observed between eusocial and solitary Hymenoptera \cite{ross2015}.
This disconnect even among insect clades points to the need for more taxonomically diverse analyses that can disentangle the role that life history, meiotic drive, and effective population size may have on the evolution of chromosome number.

\subsection{Constraints on chromosome number evolution}
In many clades, the chromosome number is likely to change primarily through fusions and fissions of existing chromosomes \cite{sved2016, blackmon2019meiotic}.
But, chromosome number could also change due to aneuploidy or whole genome duplication events that fix in a population creating duplicate copies of one or more chromosomes.
The converse chromosome number decrease due to aneuploidy is likely to be exceedingly rare since all genes on the chromosome would have to be dispensable.
When an entire chromosome is duplicated through aneuploidy all genes that are on the chromosome are then present in multiple copies and the expectation is to rapidly lose the vast majority of these duplicated genes \cite{ohno}.
Whether the copy on the duplicated or the original chromosome(s) is lost should be largely random.
This should lead to a subset of genes being retained on both the ancestral and duplicated chromosome(s).
However, these processes (fusion, fission, whole genome duplication, and aneuploidy) could all lead to sterile offspring if two populations (one with the chromosome duplication and one without) hybridise since the heterozygous offspring may have difficulty segregating unmatched chromosomes during meiosis or gametes may inherit an incomplete set of genes \cite{white1978}.
In both sexual and asexual species chromosome increase due to aneuploidy may be rare due to the impact of aneuploidy on dosage which may lead to stoichiometric imbalances in gene networks with interacting products on different chromosomes.
However, asexually reproducing species should be immune from the problem of proper segregation since they cannot outcross to an individual with a different chromosome complement. 

For these reasons, we expected to see a higher rate of chromosome number increase and decrease in asexual species since difficulties in mating with
% TS: changed compliment to complement. - reply for R2.2
individuals with different chromosome \textcolor{red}{\st{compliments}} \textcolor{blue}{complements} would be relaxed.
Our Phasmatodea dataset has a mean of 9.3 transitions from sexual to asexual reproduction and offers a chance to test this hypothesis (Table S6).
To our surprise, our analysis illustrates that rates of chromosome increase and decrease are equal in sexual and asexual Phasmatodea (Fig. \ref{fig:phas.plot}).
We interpret this as evidence that the constraints on chromosome number change via fusions, fissions, and aneuploidy are largely similar in these two groups. 
The most parsimonious explanation seems to be that the changes observed are largely neutral and that individuals that are heterozygous for chromosomal rearrangements do not typically have difficulty properly segregating chromosomes during meiosis.
In contrast, the constraints on polyploidy appear to be lifted in asexual lineages suggesting these changes may be deleterious in sexual species but neutral or nearly neutral in asexual species.

\subsection{Variation in rates of chromosome number evolution}
Most studies of chromosome evolution have been done in isolation on small clades \cite{rockman2002, mccann2016, deoliveira}. 
This creates a challenge in understanding variation in rates of chromosome number evolution across the tree of life since rates are fundamentally influenced by the time constraints and branch lengths inferred in a study (but see: \cite{blackmon2019meiotic, zenil2017}).
By inferring rates in four orders all using a common tree, we are able to make a more valid comparison among clades and determine whether some groups are evolving at significantly different rates.
We found many examples of significantly different rates of chromosome evolution among orders.
Blattodea (including or excluding Isoptera) have a higher rate of increases than Orthoptera (Table S3).
Blattodea (excluding Isoptera) have a higher rate of decrease than Isoptera and Orthoptera  (Table S3).
Decreases are also higher in Phasmatodea than Blattodea (including Isoptera), Isoptera, and Orthoptera  (Table S3).
Polyploidy is higher in Orthoptera than Blattodea (including Isoptera) and, Phasmatodea is higher than Blattodea (including Isoptera)  (Table S3).
In line with existing evidence \cite{lokki1980polyploidy, blackmon2016} polyploidy is higher in asexual than sexual species (Fig. \ref{fig:phas.plot}).
In most of these cases, it is unclear what leads to these significant differences in rates of chromosome number evolution.

One possible explanation for variation in rates of chromosome evolution is fundamental differences in the repeat content of the genome.
For instance, large numbers or recent expansions of transposable elements may lead to more frequent chromosome breakage or other structural rearrangements that change chromosome number \cite{carbone2014gibbon}.
If transposable elements have expanded in the genomes of a clade, we might expect to see a signature of this in increased genome sizes \cite{kidwell2002transposable}.
However, we found no significant association between genome size and rates of chromosome evolution suggesting that repetitive content is not a driving force in the stability of large scale genome structure across Polyneoptera.
Moving forward, the recent development of multiple probabilistic models of chromosome evolution that allow for associations with speciation or binary characters offers a way forward to further tease apart the determinants of rates of chromosome evolution \cite{freyman2018, zenil2018chromploid, blackmon2019meiotic}

Taken as a whole our results illustrate that changes in the
% TS: changed rate of chromosome evolution to rate of chromosome number evolution. - reply for R1.8
\textcolor{red}{\st{rate of chromosome evolution}} \textcolor{blue}{rate of chromosome number evolution} are widespread across large taxonomic groups.
This has important implications for our understanding of speciation processes.
For instance, while many chromosomal speciation models \cite{baker1986, white} have been thought to be unimportant in recent times, it may be that in groups like Blattodea (excluding Isoptera) with high rates of chromosomal evolution, these models may be an important source of extant diversity.
More broadly, depending on the importance of epistatic relationships, the reorganisation of the genome through fusions and fissions may be important in determining the ability of organisms to adapt to novel environments.
